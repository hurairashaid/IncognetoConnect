<h1>IncognetoConnect: Bridging University Leadership and Students</h1>
    <p>IncognetoConnect is an innovative MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to facilitate communication between university top office holders and students. By providing a student portal, each student can create issues while maintaining anonymity if desired. Additionally, students can upvote existing issues to prioritize them. To ensure the scrutiny of issues, an intermediate portal serves as a communication channel between students and upper management, ensuring that only legitimate and registered issues are escalated to the desks of office holders.</p>
